Frozen peppers, broccoli, or onions can be quickly and easily added to stews and omelets to provide color and nutrition.</p>

  <h2 id="suga">Sugars</h2>
    <p>Good nutrition is important for maintaining overall health throughout life, but many Americans do not have a healthy diet. One issue is the high consumption of added sugars in the American diet. Added sugars are sugars and syrups that are added to foods or drinks during processing or preparation, as opposed to naturally occurring sugars found in fruits or milk. Added sugars can have many different names, such as brown sugar, corn syrup, and honey. Consuming too many added sugars can contribute excess calories to the diet without providing any essential nutrients. This can lead to health problems such as weight gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease.</p>

    <p>Sugary drinks are the leading source of added sugars in the American diet so drink water!</p>

  <h2 id="mealprepin">Meal Prep</h2>
  <p>Meal prepping involves preparing a meal or recipe in advance, then dividing it into individual portions to be eaten at a later time. This can save time, money, and reduce waste in the kitchen, and is particularly convenient for those who value efficiency and control over their diet. Meal prepping is generally done for 3-7 days at a time and is best for those who don't mind eating the same things for a few days in a row. Foods that work well for meal prepping include cooked grains, pasta, beans, meat, and vegetables, whole fruit, nuts, seeds, cheese, and sauces and dips. Foods that don't usually meal prep well include softer fruits and vegetables, and crunchy items like fried foods, crackers, and chips. The length of time that meal prepped food stays "good" depends on the quality of the food when it was prepared, the way it was stored, and the individual preferences of the eater. It is important to label and date the food when storing it in the refrigerator or freezer.</p>
